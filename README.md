## Theme: "monokai22"

Admittedly "22" is a bit misleading. I fell in love with the original Monokai from TextMate. I used it in SublimeText 2 and 3. The VSCode version was good, but not exact. So I went to the very little trouble of tweaking it to the variations of the colors and grammars with which my eyes were familiar. I also removed the italics. I did this a very long time ago, but updated the tmTheme file to more readable and useful json.

It's not a very far departure, but it's the one that I love using.
